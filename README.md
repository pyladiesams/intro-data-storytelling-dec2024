# An introduction to Data Storytelling
### Presentation: [Presentation_name](workshop/Presentation_template.pptx)

## Workshop description
Data is everywhere. It is through analysis and visualization that we are able to turn data into information that can be used to drive better decision making. Out-of-the-box tools will allow you to create a chart, but if you want people to take action, your numbers need to tell a compelling story.

In this tutorial, you will learn how elements of storytelling can be applied to data visualization, and allow you to effectively tell the story in your data.
