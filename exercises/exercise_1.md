# Exercise 1

You can find the data in the `data/` folder in this repo. It is available in .csv, .xslx and .md format. The readme.md provides more context. 

1.
Spend a few moments studying the data table. What observations can you make? Write a couple of sentences with the takeaways you might highlight from this data. 

2.
Considering the takeaways you outlined in Step 1, how could you make these easier or faster to see in the current tabular view? Would changing the column or sort order, incorporating different size fonts, or using color differently help the retrieval of these key insights? Are there elements that are not central to your core observations, and could be removed or revised? How does the table formatting lookâ€”are there opportunities here to simplify to help our insights stand out? Make notes of your proposed changes.

3.
Transform the table executing the enhancements to the table you outlined in the previous. Feel free to make assumptions liberally for the purpose of this exercise.
