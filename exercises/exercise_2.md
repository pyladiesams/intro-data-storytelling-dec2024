# Exercise 2

In order to effectively communicate about your data, choosing the right chart type as a foundation is very important. Different types of charts and different ways of presenting the data have an effect on the impression it leaves on the user. 

One of the best tools we all have at our disposal when visualizing data is a blank piece of paper. In this exercise, we are going to take a few minutes to draw *as many possible ways* to visualize this data as possible. Don't focus too much on what the best form is, let your creativity spark! 


Don’t worry about plotting every specific data point exactly—make it quick and dirty to get an overall sense of what each visual could look like.
