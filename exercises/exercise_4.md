# Exercise 4

In this exercise, we are going to *redesign* the graph from the previous exericse to draw the focus to the elements of interest. 

Some things to keep in mind: 
* Declutter! Make sure everything in your graph is relevant, and none of it adds additional, unnecessary visual clutter. 
* Draw attention to the most important elements with color, a title, text, animation, arrows, or anything you want! 
* Add additional (relevant) context to your visualization.
